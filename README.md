# thecaveANDtheforest
Two very simple text-based adventure games.

The Cave is something I whipped up in a half-hour because I was bored. 
The Forest I made as a sequel. It was going to be longer, but in the end I got bored & wrapped it up pretty quickly, so it isn't terribly long either.
Try not to die and have fun!

[The Tundra](https://github.com/xavier2910/thetundra) is a sequel that has stalled.
[The Planet](https://github.com/xavier2910/theplanet) continues the story.
